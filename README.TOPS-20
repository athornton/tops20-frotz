This is the "Bring Zork Back Home" project.

I am, quixotically, in the year 2019, trying to get dumb-frotz 2.32
running on TOPS-20 on the PDP-10.

This is complicated by:

- lack of 8-bit char and 16-bit short.  I didn't bother to think
       much about this.  If you're using a 36-bit Honeywell or
       something, let me know.
