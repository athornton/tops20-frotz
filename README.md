# Frotz for TOPS-20

This is the "Bring Zork Back Home" project.

I am, quixotically, in the year 2019, trying to get dumb-frotz 2.32
running on TOPS-20 on the PDP-10.

The "unix" branch contains the modified source code; the "master" branch
has mangled filenames and symbols to make TOPS-20 happier, but it's
much less readable.

Process "unix" with https://github.com/athornton/gnusto-frotz-tops20 to
get "master".
