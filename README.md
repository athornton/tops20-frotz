# Frotz for TOPS-20

This is the "Bring Zork Back Home" project.

I am, quixotically, in the year 2019, trying to get dumb-frotz running
on TOPS-20 on the PDP-10.

The "current-unix" branch contains the modified source code; the 
"master" branch has mangled filenames and symbols to make TOPS-20
happier, but it's much less readable.  There are also branches that
represent v2.32r1.

Process "unix" with https://github.com/athornton/gnusto-frotz-tops20 to
get "master".
